# ctimage
ctimage is a project for being able to see pictures through the terminal


# Using
To use it you will have to compile it :/ <br/>
the `gcc` code is in the `.replit` file and here:<br/>
<h2>gcc -Wall ctimage.c -o ctimage -lm<h2/>


# Important
This version was just a scrap and it only shows the picture named `potato.jpg` but in the close futur I will add --command-line-arguments to display the image
